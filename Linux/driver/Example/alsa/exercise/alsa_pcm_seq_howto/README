Usage
-----
  
  Start the server with

  alsa_netcapture <soundcard> <device> <fragmentsize> <fragments>

  The server will capture from Line In or Mic In. It will permanently wait
  for connections on port 7700 while capturing. alsa_netplay-clients can 
  connect to the server and will receive the captured audio stream.

  Start clients with
 
  alsa_netplay <server address> <soundcard> <device> <fragmentsize> <fragments>

  The server_address can be either an IP aderess or a hostname.
  Soundcard and device parameters usually are both 0.
  Fragmentsize and number of fragments should be identical on 
  server and clients. A good value for the fragmentsize is 16384.
  A good choice for the number of fragments is 2.
